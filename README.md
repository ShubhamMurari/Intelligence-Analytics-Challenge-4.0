# Intelligence-Analytics-Challenge-4.0

Problem Statement 1: 

The magic of movies and their hold on the masses have made the motion picture industry 
one of the main sectors of today's global economy.Despite their inherent charms and promising 
prospects at the industry level, investing in motion pictures is still considered to be a high 
risk business for film makers, distributors, and even exhibitors, because of their alarming failure 
rates at the individual motion picture level.This high risk-high returns situation has consequently led 
many researchers to attempt the interesting and challenging task of forecasting the box office.

Problem Statement 2: 

United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals
This dataset consisted of 17 goals and 232 development indicators for all the countries between 2000-2019.

We were supposed to- 

CREATE A STORYLINE to depict how the development of the countries has been across the years. Provide a ranking to different countries based on their performance across all the goals and targets.  Which country ranks top in achievement of each goal and what all countries are at bottom of the scorecard ?
Analyze the trend of different indicators across the years, try identifying relationships across the different indicators i.e. if one indicator is impacted by the other.
Provide recommendations on how can countries ranking low on the scorecard can achieve their target goals in the coming years in a more efficient manner.  
You have the flexibility of picking up any indicators and any visual elements for your storyboard
